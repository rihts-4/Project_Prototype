# Terminal Commands Cheat Sheet

## Running the Prototype

To run the project prototype, use the following commands in your terminal:

- git clone or download the files

- `cd frontend` — Navigate to the project directory
- `npm i` — Installing dependencies
- `npm run server` — Run server on one terminal
  **IMPORTANT**
  _RUN SERVER FIRST, AND WAIT ~30 SECONDS BEFORE RUNNING APP_
  # Change the baseURL in frontend/app/services/api.js to your local API:
  # When starting server, you should see "Use this as baseURL:", f"http://{local_ip}:8000"
  # Use that one
- Create a new terminal without deleting previous one
- `npm run start` — Run app on another terminal
- Scan QR Code using Expo Go app
- `https://expo.dev/go`: link for Expo Go app

_Make sure you have all required dependencies installed before running the prototype._
